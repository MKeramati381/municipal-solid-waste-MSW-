This code models an optimized municipal solid waste (MSW) supply chain using GAMS to maximize economic efficiency. It defines key elements like cities, separation centers, plants, and waste types, with parameters for transportation, processing, and operational costs. Variables and constraints manage waste collection, separation, recycling, and disposal while ensuring capacity and operational limits. The model solves for the optimal strategy to maximize revenues from recycled materials, biofertilizers, and electricity, while minimizing costs, using a mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver.
